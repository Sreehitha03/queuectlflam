# ⚙️ QueueCTL: A Persistent, CLI-Based Background Job Queue System (Python)

**QueueCTL** is a minimal, production-grade background job queue system built in **Python**.  
It reliably executes background shell commands using **concurrent workers**, **automatic retries** with exponential backoff, and **persistent storage** that survives restarts.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Command-Line Interface built with **Python Click**  
✅ **Persistent job storage** using SQLite (`queuectl.db`)  
✅ **Concurrent worker execution** via Python’s Multiprocessing  
✅ **Automatic retry** with configurable exponential backoff  
✅ **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** for permanently failed jobs  
✅ **Race-condition safety** through atomic job acquisition  
✅ **Cross-platform input robustness** via STDIN-based JSON input

## Architecture Overview

### Concurrency & Reliability
- **Atomic Job Acquisition** ensures that no two workers process the same job simultaneously.  
- A minor `time.sleep(0.05)` ensures **database writes are fully committed** before other workers attempt job acquisition, preventing duplicate execution.  
- Job states and configuration are stored in **SQLite**, providing **data persistence** across application restarts.

### 🕓 Job Lifecycle & Backoff Logic

Jobs follow this lifecycle:  
`pending → processing → completed / failed / dead`

| State | Transition Condition | Delay (Backoff Formula) |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **pending**        | Job created | — |
| **processing**     | Worker starts executing the job | — |
| **failed (retry)** | Job fails and `attempts ≤ max_retries` | Delay = `base^attempts` seconds |
| **dead (DLQ)**     | Job fails and `attempts > max_retries` | Moved to DLQ |
| **completed**      | Command succeeds | — |


### 🧾 Usage Instructions

Use STDIN for enqueuing JSON jobs to avoid shell quoting issues across platforms.

Command     Type	    Example Command
Enqueue     Job	        echo '{"id":"job1","command":"echo Hello"}' | python -m src.cli enqueue
Check       Status	    python -m src.cli status
Start       Worker(s)	python -m src.cli worker start --count 2
View        DLQ Jobs	python -m src.cli dlq list
Retry       DLQ Job	    python -m src.cli dlq retry <job-id>

## 🧪 Validation & Demo Scenarios

To demonstrate QueueCTL’s functionality, open two terminals:

CMD A → for running workers

CMD B → for managing jobs

Below are three core scenarios that showcase the system’s capabilities.

## ▶️ Scenario 1: Basic Job Completion

Purpose:
Demonstrate successful job processing and transition from pending → completed.

Explanation:
A simple command (echo Success) is enqueued.
The worker fetches the pending job, executes it, and marks it as completed in the database.

Commands:

Terminal	Command
CMD B	echo '{"id":"S1-success","command":"echo Success in Parallel"}' | python -m src.cli enqueue
CMD A	python -m src.cli worker start --count 1
CMD B	python -m src.cli status

Expected Output:

Job S1-success transitions from pending → processing → completed.

Worker logs show successful job execution.

## ⚠️ Scenario 2: Retry, Exponential Backoff, and DLQ

Purpose:
Show how failed jobs retry automatically using exponential backoff and move to DLQ when retries exceed the limit.

Explanation:
A failing command (exit 1) is enqueued.
The system retries based on configured max_retries and back_off_base.
After exhausting retries, the job moves to the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).

Commands:

Terminal	Command
CMD B	python -m src.cli config set max-retries 1
CMD B	python -m src.cli config set back-off-base 3
CMD B	echo '{"id":"S2-fail","command":"exit 1"}' | python -m src.cli enqueue
CMD A	python -m src.cli worker start --count 1
CMD B	python -m src.cli dlq list
CMD B	python -m src.cli dlq retry S2-fail

Expected Output:

Job retries once, waiting 3^attempts seconds between tries.

After final failure, job appears in DLQ via python -m src.cli dlq list.

Retrying DLQ job re-enqueues it successfully.

## ⚙️ Scenario 3: Concurrency Safety & Parallel Execution

Purpose:
Prove multiple workers can process different jobs concurrently without duplicate acquisition.

Explanation:
Two long-running jobs (ping commands) are enqueued.
Two worker processes execute them in parallel, ensuring no overlap or race condition occurs.

Commands:

Terminal	Command
CMD B	echo '{"id":"S3-A","command":"ping -n 7 127.0.0.1 > NUL"}' | python -m src.cli enqueue
CMD B	echo '{"id":"S3-B","command":"ping -n 7 127.0.0.1 > NUL"}' | python -m src.cli enqueue
CMD A	python -m src.cli worker start --count 2
CMD B	python -m src.cli status

Expected Output:

Both jobs run simultaneously on different worker processes.

No duplicate job execution or missed state updates.

Status shows both jobs moving independently from processing → completed.
